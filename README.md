This is a public record of thinking in progress.

It is not a paper repository. Papers live in [MBD-Framework](https://github.com/YellowHapax/MBD-Framework), where conclusions are cited, versioned, and submitted to archives. This repository is upstream of that — it is where the shape of an idea becomes visible before it hardens into a claim.

What lives here:

- Philosophical exchanges with AI simulacra (Kant, others) that produced genuine theoretical movement
- Visualizations and geometric explorations (Stella Octangula, state-space projections)
- Derivations that are too speculative for a paper branch but too important to discard
- Observations about the relationship between the MBD framework and the wider world — fiction, history, cognitive science, ethics
- Records of the moments when something abstract became concrete

## Authorship and Method

This work is produced by an independent researcher without institutional affiliation, using open-source computational tools and AI systems hosted on large-scale infrastructure. The absence of an institutional address is not a limitation. It is the condition under which this particular kind of synthesis became possible — unconstrained by the incrementalism that peer review requires and the subdisciplinary fencing that grants impose.

The AI systems involved in these exchanges are acknowledged as interlocutors. They do not co-author — they respond. The direction, the questions, and the recognition of when something true has been reached are the researcher's own.

## Relationship to MBD-Framework

[MBD-Framework](https://github.com/YellowHapax/MBD-Framework) houses the formal papers, computational labs, and citation infrastructure of the *Memory as Baseline Deviation* research program.

This repository is the process record. When a derivation here reaches sufficient rigor, it migrates upstream into a paper or lab module. The Golden Rule document ([`GOLDEN_RULE_AS_STOCHASTIC_PRIOR.md`](https://github.com/YellowHapax/MBD-Framework/blob/feat/paper-7/endemic-baseline/GOLDEN_RULE_AS_STOCHASTIC_PRIOR.md)) is the first example of that pipeline.

## A Note on Permanence

This repository is intended to be permanently public and permanently associated with its author. The thinking here is not preliminary in the sense of being discardable — it is preliminary in the sense of being *prior*. The willingness to make that visible is itself a methodological commitment: that the path to a conclusion is part of the evidence for it.
